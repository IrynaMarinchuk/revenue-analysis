💰 Revenue Analysis - Financial Metrics & Cash Flow

📌 Overview  
This repository contains financial analysis projects focused on revenue trends, regional income distribution, and cash flow insights.  
Using Tableau, SQL, and Python, we explore revenue growth, paying user behavior, and product profitability.



🎯 Goals  
✔ Analyze revenue trends across different regions (USA, APAC, EMEA).  
✔ Identify key revenue drivers and underperforming products.  
✔ Evaluate paying user behavior (ARPPU, transaction frequency).  
✔ Track cash flow trends and seasonal revenue fluctuations.
